nempeers illustrate how you can use the nem blockchain for encrypted peer 2 peer chat and file transfer. The encryption keys and initial connection info are shared between participants using the blockchain, this ensures that the peer 2 peer connection can remain private and without interference from a thirds party. The application is browser based, which mean you can download the application an run it on your local machine for maximum security. The beta version is running on the testnet, so you can setup a test account and try it out.

Currently Firefox 22+ and Google Chrome 26.0.1403.0 or above is required. Note that this demo may also fail if you are behind stringent firewalls or both you and the remote peer are behind symmetric NATs.
